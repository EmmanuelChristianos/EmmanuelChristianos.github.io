# Notes on Stephen Chew's "How to Get the Most Out of Studying"
{: .fs-7.fw-300}

Firstly I would just like to add that this knowledge is owned by Stephen Chew, the videos are free to watch on youtube, however I though I would make a post covering some of Stephans big topics.

## Part 1: Beliefs That Make You Stupid
{: .fs-6 .fw-400 .d-block .no_toc}
</div>

People have learnt common misconceptions surrounding how they learn growing up. These misconceptions hinder your ability to study effectively. Dr Chew calls these misconceptions ‘Beliefs that make you stupid’. The most common are:

1. Learning is Fast. It is true that some people can learn faster than others, however majority of that difference is due to learning techniques. People who think they can read many chapters of a book and learn the information are wrong. They will ultimately finish reading before someone with effective studying techniques however they will not learn the all the content anywhere near as quickly and someone who studies effectively. This is because simply reading information is only half the battle, you need to spend approximately 50% of the time reviewing and understanding what you have read. This is called the 50/50 Rule. 
2. Knowledge is composed of isolated facts. The idea that you can understand a concept by remembering isolated facts like definitions or bullet points will only set you up to fail. Knowledge, and the ability to learn a new topic comes from comprehension, your understanding of the topic and not the memorisation of ‘Key Information’.
3. Being good at a subject is a matter of inborn talent. You will likely hear this a lot when it comes to STEM subjects like Mathematics. People will often say that they aren’t good at math and they have never been, or math doesn’t suit them etc. There is two components to this misconception:
	- STEM subjects generally build upon previous knowledge quite heavily compared to say history where you can jump around and learn a part of history fairly well without knowing what happened previously. STEM subjects however, the more advanced topics you learn generally the more they’re built on less advanced prerequisite information. If you didn’t study effectively for math in previous years you will always continue to struggle because you haven’t grasped the foundation well enough to learn the current topic. It isn’t because you’re not naturally good at it.
	- Becoming knowledgable about a certain topic requires effective study, simply if you don’t put the time in, you can’t ever expect to learn the content. 
4. I’m really good at multi-tasking. It’s a known fact that humans can’t multi-task. Instead your brain is switching quickly between 2 or more tasks. People often develop the belief that they are good at multi-tasking because they multi-task while they studying when they get bored and they still learn some of the content. The truth is, every extra task you do is a distraction, an impediment on your ability to learn efficiently. You may still be able to learn but if you compare how effective and efficient your learning is without distractions you will find that if you stop multi-tasking you will learn much more effectively. 

Dr Chew, Introduces a concept called ‘Metacognition’. Metacognition is about how well you understand your level of comprehension for at topic. Weaker students have bad metacognition, meaning the will often go into a test  feeling like they understand the content well and will be surprised when they get their marks back to see that they have performed poorly. Students with better metacognition will come out of the exam knowing that they couldn’t answer some questions fully or at all and better estimate their results. Poor metacognition leads to ineffective study as you are overconfidence in your level of comprehension of the knowledge.

## Part 2: What Students Should Know About How People Learn
{: .fs-6 .fw-400 .d-block .no_toc}
</div>
Learning styles have an aspect called ‘Level of Processing’, this ranges from shallow level processing to deep level.

### Shallow Level Processing
{: .fs-5 .fw-500 .d-block .no_toc}

Shallow level processing focuses on the meaningless aspects of the concepts you’re learning. These aspects might be the spelling of the words, memorisation of sentences etc. Shallow level processing regardless of your intent to learn the information is incredibly ineffective for studying. The most common studying techniques that fall under this category would be trying to remember definitions or bold text in textbooks. 

### Deep Level Processing
{: .fs-5 .fw-500 .d-block .no_toc}

Deep level processing focuses on the subjective meaning of the information you are learning. Deep level processing enhances comprehension of the topic. With deep level processing you relate new information to existing information in your brain which creates stronger connections allowing you to recall that information easier. Practicing the retrieval of that information in the manner you will be tested in also falls under deep level processing and will help you retrieve this information easier in the future. You will learn information effectively with deep level processing regardless of your intent to learn.

### What is important when it comes to learning new information?
{: .fs-5 .fw-500 .d-block .no_toc}
\\
What doesn’t work
{: .fs-5 .fw-400}
People incorrectly believe that your intent to learn information is important when it comes to learning. This is only true in so far as a lack of intent to learn will often mean extra distraction around yourself which will be the factor impeding your learning effectiveness. Your intent itself plays no role in your ability to learn new information. Nor does your learning style. There isn’t sufficient evidence to support the fact that ‘learning styles’ impact your learning capability. The time you spend studying is important in learning as, you cannot do minimal work and expect to come away with an understanding of a topic, however time alone isn’t enough. 

What does work
{: .fs-5 .fw-400}
The single most important thing that impacts your ability to learn a concept is ‘What you think about while studying’. More specifically, the level of processing that is going on during your study. If you use shallow level processing techniques you can expect to learn less effectively that if you were to you deep level processing techniques. This is the main aspect you should focus on improving in your studying if you are looking to improve your grades.

## Part 3: Cognitive Principles for Optimizing Learning
{: .fs-6 .fw-400 .d-block .no_toc}
</div>

Principles for Achieving Deep Processing

### Elaboration
{: .fs-5 .fw-500 .d-block .no_toc}
Elaborating on a topic increases the meaningful connections of that topic within your brain by relating that topic to relevant information you already know. The more meaningful connection you have the easier it will be to recall the new information in the future. 

### Distinctiveness
{: .fs-5 .fw-500 .d-block .no_toc}
Elaborating is focussed on making meaningful connections to existing knowledge, where distinctiveness is focused on outlining the differences between different concepts. Distinctiveness allows you to form clear understanding of concepts in your head by emphasising the boundaries of those concepts. 

### Personal
{: .fs-5 .fw-500 .d-block .no_toc}
The personal aspect of deep processing is focussed on relating new information back to personal experience. Relating new information to personal experience allows you to make meaningful connection to already cemented knowledge in your brain. 

### Appropriate Retrieval and Application
{: .fs-5 .fw-500 .d-block .no_toc}
If you recall information in a way that is uncommon to you, it can make it more difficult to recall due to the fact that there are less connections made in that area of the brain. Practicing the way in which your knowledge will have to be applied will make you better at retrieving that information in similar situations.

### Learning Goals
{: .fs-6 .fw-500 .d-block .no_toc}
### Automaticity
{: .fs-5 .fw-500 .d-block .no_toc}
Automaticity is when a process is so well known that it becomes automatic and requires very little if any effort or thinking at all. The reasons why developing new learning skills is so difficult is because previous bad habits have become automatic. It’s an ongoing process to now make deep processing skills the new automatic. 

### Overlearning
{: .fs-5 .fw-500 .d-block .no_toc}
Over-learning is the process of learning a concept so well that not only can you recall that information but you can do so very quickly. 

<div id="yellowHeading" markdown="1">
## Part 4: Putting Principles for Learning into Practice
{: .fs-6 .fw-400 .d-block .no_toc}
</div>

The following are some good study habits that focus on deep level processing.

### Question Generation
{: .fs-5 .fw-500 .d-block .no_toc}

This studying method focuses on developing meaningful questions from the content you just consumed. Generating good questions will force you to think deeply about the content and not just the definitions mentioned. It will also allow you to make links to different areas in the content and to previous information you might have learnt taking advantage of deep level processing characteristics such as Elaboration, Distinctiveness and so on. Generating questions that required the use of many of the deep level processing techniques help in cementing your comprehension of the topic. 

### Concepts Maps
{: .fs-5 .fw-500 .d-block .no_toc}

Concepts Maps are maps made up from nodes which are concepts and links which link the concepts together. These maps are helpful in visualising how many different concepts link together, similar to the elaboration concept which makes you link concepts in your head to other relevant concepts. It also emphasises distinctiveness as you have to create differentiate between concepts for node creation. 

### Practice Retrieving Information in Ways The Teacher Expects
{: .fs-5 .fw-500 .d-block .no_toc}

This strategy has 2 sections. 

1. Practice retrieving information without referring to notes. 
2. Practice using the information in ways the teacher will ask you to in the future. 

Storing information in memory is just one half of learning something new. Recalling information without practice can be like sticking your hand into a pitch black closet and hoping to find what your looking for. Practicing recalling information will turn the lamp on inside your head.  

## Taking Notes In Class 
{: .fs-6 .fw-400 .d-block .no_toc}

Taking notes in class is a tricky task. The goal isn’t to take down every bit of content learned. It instead should be used as  

1. Key summaries of big concepts in your own words. Simply copying down a description of an idea or concept won’t help you understand. However rewriting the concepts and summarising them will force you to write the concept in your own words and if you wish to come out with a legible summary you will need to have an understanding of the concept first.
2. Bullet Points on topics that you didn’t have time to make summaries on. This is so you can go back to retrieve this information later. 
3. A tool to help you engage in the conversation of the class. Taking notes and making summaries requires an understanding of the topic. The areas in which you lack understanding will quickly  become apparent when you are making these summaries which then gives you the opportunity to engage and ask question for further clarification.              

## Highlighting textbook information
{: .fs-6 .fw-400 .d-block .no_toc}
Highlighting textbook information can be used for deep and shallow level processing. Shallow level processing through highlighting would be to highlight definitions and bold text. Deep level process through highlighting would be very patching highlighting, words being chosen in sentences for their meaning and no others.

## Part 5: I Blew the Exam, Now What?
{: .fs-6 .fw-400 .d-block .no_toc}
</div>

These are Dr Chews Do’s And Don’ts for when you fail an exam.

### Do’s
{: .fs-5 .fw-500 .d-block .no_toc}
1. Exam how you prepared. If you spent very little time preparing then spending more time in the future would a good place to start improving. However if you spent a dent time preparing but still received a bad mark, maybe the problem lies elsewhere like your note taking or study methods.
2. Review the exam. If you struggled in all most/all areas of the exam you need to look at how you prepared for those areas. Were you studying the concepts that were being examined? Maybe it was your study method that failed you. If you did badly in only a few select areas then maybe your study habits are fine but the notes you had created for those areas where insufficient.
3. Talk with you professor. You professor can provide a lot of great tips to help you in studying and preparing for future exams.
4. Examine your studying habits. Maybe your study habits are very shallow level processing habits and you need to switch to deeper level habits. Maybe you need to get rid of other bad habits like multi-tasking or ineffective group study.
5. Develop a plan based on what you have gathered and follow that plan for the next examination. 

### Don’ts
{: .fs-5 .fw-500 .d-block .no_toc}
1. Don’t keep studying the same way and hope for improvement. Use the skills mentioned in this page. 
2. Don’t wait until the end of semester to seek help. By this time a good amount of the grades will have already been marked in assignments and are too late to improve. 
3. Skip one class to focus on another. This often creates poor performance now in both of those classes. You need to find a way to mange attending and working on both classes. 
4. Crams at the last minute. This is an ineffective learning method and remembering method.
