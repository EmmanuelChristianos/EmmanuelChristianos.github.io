## About The Project

### Educational Purposes

Breaking&Entering aims to provide the aspiring Cyber Security Analysts, Penetration Testers or otherwise curious and eager to learn individuals a 'bottom-up' platform to acquiring and practicing skills relating to Cyber Security and Network Infrastructure. B&E also provides comprehensive educational content covering large portions of testable material for selective industry certifications.
{: .fs-5 .fw-200 }

Security concepts are divided into chapters, for each covered chapter all the relevant information will be provided in a manner that aims to remove redundant information, strip away unnecessary language and construct an understanding of the concept that is clear. Chapters provide guides to setup the required environment on all major operating systems. Chapters will provide the relevant prerequisite knowledge that is necessary to fully understand the overarching concept. Chapters will then, using the environment that you set up, using the prerequisite knowledge you have gained, teach you from the bottom-up.
