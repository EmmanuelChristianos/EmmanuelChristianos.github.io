## About The Project

### Our Approach

Breaking&Entering aims to provide the aspiring Cyber Security Analysts, Penetration Testers or otherwise curious and eager to learn individuals a 'bottom-up' platform to acquire and practice skills relating to Cyber Security and Network Infrastructure. B&E also provides comprehensive educational content covering large portions of testable material for selective industry certifications.
{: .fs-5 .fw-200 }

Security concepts are divided into chapters, for each covered chapter all the relevant information will be provided in a manner that aims to remove redundant information, strip away unnecessary language and construct an understanding of the concept that is clear. Chapters provide guides to set up the required environment on all major operating systems. Chapters will provide the relevant prerequisite knowledge that is necessary to fully understand the overarching concept. Chapters will then, using the environment that you set up and the prerequisite knowledge you have gained, teach you from the bottom-up.

## Chapter Structure

Chapters divide information into 4 main categories. These categories facilitate the 'bottom up' approach to learning security concepts. Each category aims to provide you with all the sufficient information needed to follow along with the rest of the chapter. Those categories are represented by the following:
{: .fs-5 .fw-200 }
 
<div markdown="1">

<div  markdown="1">
Environment setup
{: .label .label-green}

The 'Environment Setup' label aims to provide all users, regardless of the platform they are using, an environment for engaging with the rest of the chapter that will align with the instruction that will be provided. The environment setup refers to methods of OS installation, OS configuration and dependency setup. This sub-chapter helps avoid ambiguity and confusion relating to exercise instructions. In saying this, following the steps in this sub-chapter will not ensure that you only have to complete the instruction laid out in the core knowledge section. Further settings or dependencies may need to be configured beyond the scope of what these instructions have provided. If this happens to be the case, you may contact B&E and we may be able to help resolve any environment setup issues.

<div  markdown="1">
Prerequisite knowledge
{: .label .label-purple}

The 'Prerequisite knowledge' label outlines all the relevant knowledge needed to understand and complete the 'Core Knowledge' sub-chapter. The depth of the knowledge provided in this section aims to only go so far as whats needed to understand the information in the chapters. If you would like to learn more about the knowledge covered, further learning sources will be listed at the end of the section as a recommended reading list. 
{: .fs-5 .fw-200 }
</div>

<div  markdown="1">
Core Knowledge
{: .label .label-yellow}

The 'Core Knowledge' label identifies that the corresponding information is part of the fundamental knowledge that the chapter or sub-chapter is aiming to familiarize you with. Core knowledge sections have been analyzed to determine the prerequisite knowledge required to understand the content, and this information is provided within the prerequisite knowledge section. The sub-chapter will commonly contain exercises and files needed to follow along with its instructions. For each chapter a Github repository will be made to hold the the aforementioned files for readers to use along with the chapters' instructions. 
{: .fs-5 .fw-200 }
</div>

<div  markdown="1">
Next Step
{: .label .label-red}

The 'Next Step' label details where you can move to next, whether it be further practice of the skills acquired or recommendations regarding new topics that have the knowledge acquired as a prerequisite.

## Chapter Without A Category 

If a category isn't needed in a chapter for instance, a chapter that required no prerequisite knowledge, then the corresponding section will be left out.
